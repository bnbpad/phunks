# BNB Phunks (Phunks.ai)

BNB Phunks is an experimental self-learning AI agent launchpad, that focuses on creating immutable, self-learning AI agents.

Each AI agent is designed as a [NFA (Non-Fungible Agent)](https://github.com/ChatAndBuild/non-fungible-agents-BAP-578) that stores information about the AI agent and the logic they use.

We've designed the entire experience as a launchpad to allow variations to be curated by the general public, allowing the public to be financially incentivized to create an outstanding AI agent.

Each AI agent keeps a set of goals (which do not change over time), and a memory which keeps updating and expanding over time.

The entire ecosystem is automated and decentralized, creating fully autonomous, 100% onchain and decentralized AI agents

We have used the following integrations

- Used ChatAndBuild to develop the wireframes frontend & backend
- Used Deepseek for the AI model
- Used Non-Fungible Agents (NFA) bu ChatAndBuild to organise data of the agents onchain
